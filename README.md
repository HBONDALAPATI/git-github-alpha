	Version Control Tools
	GitHub & Git, Git Features, Git Operations & Commands 
	Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. 
	GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories
	Version control is the management of changes to documents, computers programs, large web sites, and other collections of information  
	These changes are usually termed as “Versions”. 
	Snapshots of all versions are properly documented and stored 
	Versions are also named accurately  
	Git repository has number of versions 
	In any case if your central, a backup is always available in your local servers 
	Microsoft acquired in June of 2018, its larger rival GitHub in 2018 for $7.5 billion

4.	What are the Features of Git? 
	Distributed: Allows distributed development of code. Every developer has a local copy of the entire development history and changes are copied from one repository to another. 
	Compatible: Compatible with existing systems and protocols. SVN & SVK repositories can be directly accessed using Git-SVN
	Non-linear: Supports non-linear development of software. Includes various techniques to navigate & visualize non-linear development history 
	Branching: It takes only a few seconds to create & merge branches. Master branch always contains production quality code.   
	Lightweight: Uses lossless compression technique to compress data on the client’s side
	Speed: Fetching data from local repository is 100 times faster than remote repository. GIT is one order of magnitude faster than other VCS tools  
	Open Source: You can modify its source code according to your needs 
	Reliable: On events of system crash, the lost data can be easily recovered from any of the local repositories of the collaborators 
	Secure: Uses SHA1 to name and identity objects. Every file & commit is check summed and is retrieved by its checksum at time of checkout
	Economical: Released under (General Public License) GPL’s license. It is for free. All heavy lifting is done on client-side, hence a lot of money can be saved on costly servers. 
 

5.	What is a Repository? 
A directory or storage space where your projects can live. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it storage space on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, you can name it, inside a repository. 
There are two types of repositories: 
1.	Central Repository 
2.	Local Repository 
 
6.	Git Operations and commands?
